      <h5>Course Description</h5>
      <p>

This	course	introduces	the	history	and	practical	use	of	network	and	hypermedia	technologies	in
an	artistic	context.	You	will	not	only	study	the	development	and	structure	of	the	Web	in	an
historical	and	theoretical	sense,	but	also	gain	practical	experience	working	with	markup	and
scripting	languages	to	use	the	internet	as	a	creative	medium.	Class	time	will	consist	of
workshop-style	lessons	on	techniques,	as	well	as	discussions	of	weekly	readings.	Homework	will
involve	theoretical	and	historical	readings	each	week,	and	projects	in	which	you	will	create,
appropriate	and	transform	the	web	for	art.	The	class	assumes	minimal	previous	programming
experience,	and	simply	asks	that	you	be	curious,	energetic,	rigorous	and	willing	to	try	new
things.
