        In my artwork Quick &amp; Easy Recipes for Disaster, a hybrid media
installation involving Internet and augmented reality components produces
randomly generated, 'impossible' recipes, in both textual and 'cooked' 3D model
form. A program called Recipeater draws from a database of hundreds of
ingredients, implements and processes and computationally recombines them to
produce speculative recipes, unmooring the idea of food from its edible
representation. Participants in the installation view the food online as a typical
recipe blog post, and as a 3D model tracked and projected onto a plate through
an augmented reality application called EntréAR. EntréAR takes the recipes
generated by Recipeater and performs them algorithmically on a database of 3D
scanned ingredients to produce a 3D model of the dish described in the recipe.
This resulting virtual dish is projected and tracked to a plate via augmented
reality. The conceptual circuit of the piece is completed by the gesture of the
participant who consumes the food by taking a 'food pic' of it and sharing it to
social media. The physical form of the food withdraws from the scene, disclosing
the interface itself as object. Quick &amp; Easy Recipes for Disaster is an aesthetic
system that attempts to understand the nature of the experience of social media
and the Internet, through the tropic figure of food and its mediated online form.
