        is a collaboration with Penelope Umbrico. I extracted the Google
        Earth topographic data for the geo-location of Ansel Adamsâ€™
        photograph, The Tetons and Snake River, to create a 3D model of Mount
         Moran pictured in it. Here, the ancient stable form of the mountain,
         first captured as a singular monument in a photograph (a process
         which begins with natural light), moves in multiple iterations
         through infinitely reproducible and distributable code on the web
         (the manufactured light of pixel; 3D model), to end with the image
         of Mount Moran on Google Earth as an independent object through the
         3D printing of its associated image data. Penelope and I suggest an
         equivalency here - if the individual photographers were once the
         masters of how we viewed the natural world, for better or for
         worse, we now view the world through a master Google lens. Taken
         from monumental earth through digital code, the mountain ends in
         reconstituted earth again - a small ceramic specter of a mountain.
