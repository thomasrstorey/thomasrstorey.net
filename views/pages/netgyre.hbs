          Netgyre is a simulation and visualization of the waste generated
          by transport across the networked world. Taking formal inspiration
          from the “trash islands” generated by the confluence of garbage
          caught in the oceanic currents of the oceans, the garbage in
          Netgyre is a model of a trashcan that I 3D scanned, textured with
           images generated from dynamic webpages, which are in turn
           generated from the unique data obtained from each client who
           connects to the page. Every time someone visits the site, they
           contribute another unit of garbage to the simulation, adding one
            more set of calculations per second to the server running the
            simulation, generating that much more waste heat from the
            operation of the perpetual program, adding another several
            thousand bytes to the memory allocated, and thus the entropy
            generated, by the software. You can disconnect and look away,
            try to forget that it is there, but it is always spinning away
            in its networked virtual space. Built with threejs, nodejs,
            phantomjs and WebCamjs.
