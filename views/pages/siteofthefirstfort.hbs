          <a href="http://art-tech.arts.ufl.edu/~tstorey/siteofthefirstfort/">Site of the First Fort</a>
          is a website that presents an interactive
          map of a fictional archipelago. Clicking on a location on an
          islands calls up a narrative of events related to the selected
          location. The landforms of the archipelago are drawn from the
          algorithmically generated UV layout from a 3D photogrammetric scan
          of a monument in the St. Augustine Fountain of Youth Archaeological
          Park. The text of the original monument, rendered in relief on a
          plaque set on the concrete of the memorial, reads: "SITE OF THE
          FIRST FORT, SAN JUAN DE PINOS, BUILT BY PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES
          AD 1565, DESTROYED 21 YEARS LATER BY SIR FRANCIS DRAKE AD 1586".
        </p><p>
          The narratives are generated by a Markov chain model composed of
          historical marker text from throughout the state of Florida,
          articles drawn from Wikipedia on early Florida history and the
          Fountain of Youth, and a first hand narrative written by Hernando
          D'Escalante Fontaneda who lived among the Calusa indians in Florida
          for 17 years after being shipwrecked in 1549. The names of the places
          clicked on are generated from a probabalistic grammar that combines
          names and nouns with the names of various landforms, some found in
          Florida and some not. The motivation for this piece is in response
          to the recent reports of the term "climate change" being banned
          from use by employees of the Florida Department of Environmental
          Protection, in the interest of the state government's commitment
          to "true facts".
        </p><p>
          With this piece I bring the human reality of Florida into
          confrontation with the physical reality of climate change and the
          earth's physical processes as hyperobject. The archipelago, drawn
          from the mediation of the form of the monument (which performs the
          conceptual work of nailing down a particular hypothetical time and
          place) operates as a conductive reference to the ultimate destiny
          of the territory of Florida in the case of catastrophic sea-level
          rise: to disappear under the waves like Atlantis. The Markov chain
          generated narratives are the product of a literal stirring
          together of the myriad perspectives that together constitute the
          state of Florida over time and space. It is an inventive destruction,
          in which the particularities of information are melted together to
          create potential pasts.
